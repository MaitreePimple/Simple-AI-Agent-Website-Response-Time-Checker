This project is a basic AI-Agent built using Google Gemini API.
The agent takes a user query like:

"What is the response time for google.com?"

and responds with the simulated response time for the website.

It demonstrates how an AI-Agent can:

Use a system prompt to understand instructions.

Parse structured JSON responses.

Call a custom Python function (get_response_time) to complete tasks.

Maintain a conversation loop until the task is resolved.

✨ Features

).

🧩 Demonstrates function calling from AI output.

🖥️ Implements a simple custom action (get_response_time).

🔄 Runs in a loop, simulating multi-turn conversation with the AI.

🐍 Written in Python with a clean modular structure.
